# Welcome to Lambda TL Feedback!
~~Mapped to Lambda Dashboard export available as of 11/24/19~~

UPDATE as of 12/2/19: <br>
- Lambda has updated their student feedback export. Columns and indices need to be remapped.  
- I am no longer a TL (after finishing with Web23). As my students have been assigned to a new TL my export has no data :/
- Anybody who IS still a TL please feel free to fork and continue adding to this but I will not be able to verify or maintain this repo
- The first addition I was going to add today was to create a columnCheck function that finds the appropriate column and its index before attempting to filter for those specific columns. If this triggers an error it would stop the program and inform the user that the .csv output has changed from the last working version.

## Language
Python3

## Get Started
1. Go to your Lambda TL dashboard
2. Navigate to: Overview > Student Feedback
3. At the bottom left of the component click the export button. This will give you a `.csv` of your data
4. Find the absolute path to your downloaded `.csv` data. You can do this by clicking and dragging from your file explorer / finder into an open terminal window

5. Download ZIP of the repo from the most recent commit titled: VERSION: # 
6. In your terminal navigate into the `TL_Feedback` directory and run `python3 __mainFunction__.py`

7. Follow prompts
